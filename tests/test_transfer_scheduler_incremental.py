"""TransferScheduler dispatches from a dirty set instead of sweeping every graph.

The scheduler used to visit every in-flight graph on every call. Dependencies
never cross graphs, so a graph can only expose new ready ops after one of its
own ops completes -- visiting only the changed graphs is equivalent.

These tests pin that equivalence down: a reference implementation of the old
full-sweep behavior is driven in lockstep with the real scheduler over random
DAGs, and both must dispatch the same ops and complete the same graphs on every
tick. Separate tests cover where the new scheduler deliberately differs
(non-terminal virtual ops), where it must not regress (losing a dirty bit on
error), and the limit of that guarantee (ops an exception loses regardless).
